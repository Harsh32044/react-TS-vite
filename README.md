# Taskify - The TODO App
This is a simple NoteTaking App I created using React and TypeScript, with Vite as the build tool.

Running Live: https://beyondtodo.netlify.app/

To run the app locally:

1. Fork and clone the repository into your local: https://github.com/Harsh32044/react-TS-vite.git
2. Install required dependencies by running 'npm install'
3. After installing dependencies, do 'npm run dev'

Feel free to contribute!
